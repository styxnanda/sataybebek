# Satya Ananda Personal Site

Single-page personal website built with Next.js (App Router).

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Content Editing

All page content lives in markdown files inside the `content/` directory:

- `content/hero.md`
- `content/experience.md`
- `content/education.md`
- `content/projects.md`

Update those files to change the text, then reload the page.
